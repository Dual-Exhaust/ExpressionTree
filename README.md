# ExpressionTree

ExpressionTree builds the postfix and prefix expressions from the entered infix expression and then outputs a binary tree representation of the expression. It also will display the result of the expression if possible.

# Requirements
 - Windows 10

# Installation
Download the zip file containing the code in this repository. Extract the files from the zip file. Inside expressiontree/dist, there is a bootstrap executable that launches the program. Double click it to run.

# Supported Operations:

 - Multiplication: *
 - Division: /
 - Addition: +
 - Subtraction: -
 - Powers: ^

As long as the expression that is passed by the user is a proper expression, results will be output.

# Output:
The program outputs the original infix expression provided, the postfix and prefix equivalents of the expression, the binary expression tree that represents the expression and also the result (if the operands passed were single digit integers). If any character is included in the expression that is not an operator and not a single digit integer, buildtree will not be able to calculate a result and only the equations and binary tree will be printed. 

The binary tree prints sideways, with the right-most node at the top and the left-most node at the bottom.
